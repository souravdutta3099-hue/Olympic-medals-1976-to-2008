üß∞ Step-by-Step Guide to Build & Publish
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone a starter repo
Bash
Copy Edit
Git Clone https://github.com/Summer-Olympics-Analysis.git
2Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the existing model
‚Ä¢	Inspect Data Model: athlete, medal, country, year, sport tables.
‚Ä¢	See how measures for total/silver/gold/bronze medals and gender splitting are constructed.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add or adjust visuals for your spec
Requirement	Visual Type	Implementation Notes
Total, Silver, Gold, Bronze medals	Card visuals	Use COUNTROWS with medal filters
Year selection	Slicer	Date or numeric slicer
Gender Tree map	Tree map	Group by field "Men/Women"
Medal-type Tree map	Tree map	Group by "Gold/Silver/Bronze"
Medal by Gender	Pie chart	Count of Medals by gender
Top 5 Countries medal count	Stacked column chart	Filter top 5
Top 5 Sports medal count	Clustered bar chart	Similar filter by sport
Athlete‚Äìmedal matrix	Matrix	Athletes VS medal types
Top 5 Sports Tree map	Tree map	Same top-5 logic
4Ô∏è‚É£ Create needed Measures
Examples:
DAX
Copy Edit
Total Medals = COUNT ROWS('Medal Table')
Gold Medals = CALCULATE([Total Medals],Medal Table[Medal Type] = "Gold")
Silver Medals =  ...
Bronze Medals =      ...
Medals By Gender = COUNT ROWS(...)
And similar measures for top N and matrix.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Add interactivity
‚Ä¢	Ensure slicers (Year, Gender) cross-filter all visuals.
‚Ä¢	Use bookmarks or page drill-through if needed.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Polish & publish
